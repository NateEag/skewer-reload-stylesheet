* Consider using Emacs' existing compile infrastructure for transpilation. I'm
  not sure it actually would improve the UX, but it would make the package
  smaller. I guess people who already use compile.el would find it easier to
  adapt to the package. compile-command and compilation-finish-functions are
  what I'm thinking of here.
