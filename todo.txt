* Register an after-revert-hook to reload the stylesheet. This is only really
  relevant when auto-revert is on, and I need to be careful not to break
  anyone's setup, so perhaps make it opt-in? I mostly run into this with magit
  mode, but it would apply to any stylesheet under version control, I'd think,
  or files generated by a filesystem watcher.

* Consider using Emacs' existing compile infrastructure for transpilation. I'm
  not sure it actually would improve the UX, but it would make the package
  smaller. I guess people who already use compile.el would find it easier to
  adapt to the package. compile-command and compilation-finish-functions are
  what I'm thinking of here.
